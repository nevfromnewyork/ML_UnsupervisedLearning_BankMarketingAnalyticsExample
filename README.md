# ML Unsupervised Learning -- Bank Marketing Analytics Example

In this example, we are looking to help our banking client improve their marketing campaigns by identifying the optimal number of customer segments for their credit card clients.  Using a dataset that consists of customer data that includes ten different features. The data columns were anonymized using generic names to protect customers' privacy, and data values were already normalized.

Use the starter code to accomplish the following tasks:
1. Load the raw data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
3. Segment the data with K-means using the optimal number of clusters.
